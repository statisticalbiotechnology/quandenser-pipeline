\section{Summary}

The primary objective of the project is to develop a pipeline for label-free MS data by utilizing the workflow manager \textit{Nextflow} in conjunction with a containerization software named\textit{Singularity}, to embed software that processes MS data to protein quantification results. A GUI will then be constructed to make the pipeline easy to use. The estimated time to finish the pipeline and the GUI is 10 weeks.

The tool will then be tested on two bacterial datasets generated in Paul Hudson’s lab using tandem-MS, one of which was created by growing cyanobacteria under different conditions \cite{michael}. The microbial data sets were generated by analyzing the proteome of two different lithotrophic bacteria.

The main stakeholders are Lukas Käll, who is the supervisor of the project and the developer of Quandenser, while Peter Savolainen is the secondary stakeholder who is the examiner of the project

The final product will be available to the public at Github, to allow researchers to freely download and use the software. If the tool is sufficiently easy and accurate, it would later affect the public in a positive way when the research makes it's way to clinics and other areas of society.
