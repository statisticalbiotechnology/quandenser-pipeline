\section{Business case}

The project is built from open-source programs, which will make it difficult to make the project commericially viable. However, the main dependency is under Apache License Version 2.0, which states that you are allowed to use the software for commercial purposes.

However, if the pipeline is easy to use and efficient, Lukas KÃ¤ll and Matthew The might be able to use the pipelines for other projects and perhaps convince other researchers to use the pipeline for their projects.

It is also possible that companies could be interested in using either the pipeline or part of the pipeline when doing research.
