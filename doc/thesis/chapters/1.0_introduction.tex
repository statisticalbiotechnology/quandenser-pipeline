\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Mass spectrometry-based Proteomics is currently the most comprehensive technique to analyze protein content in biological samples. Modern MS generate vast amounts of data and the analysis of such data is generally considered as a bottleneck, both due to the volume of data but also as the methods for processing the data are complex and need manual intervention. As it is hard to recreate the exact software environment used during processing, the majority of all results produced with mass spectrometers cannot be accurately reproduced outside of the lab where it was initially generated.

Containerization and workflow management is a way to remedy the situation. Containerization is a technique to install software, not into a particular computer, but into a virtual container environment, in a so-called image. The image is a file which can be distributed to several separate computers, yet is guaranteed to execute in the exact same way regardless of the operating system. There are several such containerization techniques available. Here, we will focus on one named \textit{Singularity}, as it is the preferred solution of most High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, such as UPPMAX \cite{singularity} \cite{singularity-uppmax}. The main benefit with using Singularity images are that the images can be executed without systems administrator privileges, meaning any user can freely execute the image.

The second concept, workflow management, deals with how different pieces of dependent software can be consequently executed in a particular environment. Again, there are several workflow managers available, but the one used was \textit{NextFlow}, as it currently is a preferred solution for sequencing data at SciLifeLab \cite{nextflow}. Nextflow also has the benefit to be able to utilize software images in the workflow, meaning the improved compatibility between the Singularity image and Nextflow.


\subsection{The project}
The aim of the project was to utilize containerization to embed a software named \textit{Quandenser}, a newly created software made in SciLifeLab by Lukas KÃ¤ll and Matthew The, which condenses quantification data from label-free MS experiments \cite{quandenser}. In unison with several other software embedded in the container, a workflow was created based on Nextflow with the aim to analyze MS generated data to protein quantification results.

Two bacterial mass spectrometry data sets generated in SciLifeLab were used to test the performance of the pipeline. The first data set were generated by letting cyanobacteria grow in five different simulated environments (before dawn, after dawn, noon, before sunset and after sunset) with two replicates each. The second bacterial data set was ralstonia bacteria being grown in a chemostat bioreactor where Formic Acid (FA) was limited during the experiment, in five different conditions (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 growth-rate) with four replicates each.

The pipeline was then compared to other established methods of processing the same data, i.e running two data sets and comparing how well the pipelines performed.
