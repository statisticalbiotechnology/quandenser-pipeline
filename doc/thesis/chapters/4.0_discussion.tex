\subsection{The pipelines}

\subsubsection{Performances}
The performances of Quandenser-pipeline was significantly faster than MaxQuant on both data sets, 123\% faster for the cyanobacterial data set (10 files) and 144\% faster on the ralstonia data set (20 files), as seen in figure \ref{fig:processing-local}. Comparing Quandenser-pipeline to OpenMS, Quandenser-pipeline was only slightly faster than OpenMS for both data sets. In figure \ref{fig:processing-local-cores}, the core minutes of the processes are shown, which signifies how much resources the software used to process the data. Both Quandenser-pipeline and OpenMS were shown to use much less resources than MaxQuant, where Quandenser-pipline used 176\% respectively 296\% less cpu minutes than MaxQuant.

\subsubsection{Parallel performance of the pipeline}
In figure \ref{fig:processing-local}, the parallelization showed minor improvements processing times, compared to a non-parallel run of Quandenser for the cyanobacteria data set, but showed no improvements on the ralstonia data set. The parallel process used more resources to process the same data, as seen in figure \ref{fig:processing-local-cores}, where the parallel process used more core minutes for the same data set.

In figure \ref{fig:timeline-local}, the reason for the phenomenon is illustrated. In the third parallelization step, each calculation should ideally be similar in processing speed, since measuring the calculation time on a non-parallel run show very similar processing time for each process (not illustrated in the report). However, the timeline for the parallel run show something different, the processing times increases with time, up to a factor of three. The reason is due to two factors; unaccounted overhead calculations in the modified Quandenser and CPU limitations. The first factor was that Quandenser was not designed to parallelize computation in the particular way the pipeline does, which results in overhead calculations taking up much of the wall time. The parallelization in the pipeline spawns a completely new process of Quandenser, thus needs to recomputate the internal parameters. The second factor is the CPU limitation, which slows down the parallel processes due to the processes share the same CPU. To combat the problem, an option in the pipeline was added to allow users to parallelize only the first part of Quandenser, resulting in a minor speed boost.

Another drawback with using parallel computation option of the pipeline is that the waiting time on the SLURM cluster for each process slows down the parallelization, meaning that a non-parallel run would be faster in some cases when the HPC cluster is under a heavy load, resulting in increased waiting time for each submitted process. In figure \ref{fig:timeline-cluster}, the waiting time is illustrated as the grey part of the bars, which are substantially larger than the calculation time of the Quandenser processes, which are the colored part of the bars. On a local computer, the waiting time for each process is negligible, while the impact of the SLURM queue waiting times for a non-parallel run is much smaller, due to less processes means less wait time.

However, the parallel process execution for the pipeline is only an option which the user of the pipeline can choose and a non-parallel run of Quandenser does not have a significant SLURM waiting time compared to a parallel run, which negates the drawbacks mentioned above. The framework for paralellization of Quandenser in the pipeline could still be useful for future improvements to optimize Quandenser for parallel computation.

\subsection{The biological data}
The results from the pipeline showed several differentially expressed proteins on both data sets. Analyzing the data yielded from the cyanobacterial data set, we can see some similarities between previous studies of cyanobacteria grown in different conditions.

The protein slr0473 is a Phytochrome, a protein which is involved in phosphorylation and had significantly higher expression in groups growing in conditions in group A, B and E (before sunrise, after sunrise and after sunset, respectively) \cite{phytochrome}. As shown in a previous study, the expression of slr0473, also known as histidine kinase protein (Cph1), was shown to increase in cyanobacterial cells when light intensity was low and would later decrease when upon reillumination, thus confirming the findings from the pipeline \cite{phytochrome-dark}.

The protein ssr3383 is a Phycobilisome linker polypeptide antenna protein, which links to the phycobiliproteins, a type of light harvesting protein complexes in present cyanobacteria and red algae that makes up the Phycobilisome \cite{phycobilisomes}. The linker polypeptides have been found to change depending on the light levels in previous studies \cite{cyano-low-light}. The differential expression of the phycobilisomes were also found in a previous study by researchers at Paul Hudson's lab (the origin of the analyzed data) of cyanobacteria in low light conditions, which confirms the protein level changes \cite{michael-jahn-cyano}.

The protein sll1184 is a heme oxygenase, an enzyme in cyanobacteria which synthesizes chromophores, light-absorbing molecules that are part phyhycobiliproteins, as explained above \cite{heme-oxygenase} \cite{heme-oxygenase-2}. Cyanobacteria grown in simulated environments before sunrise and after sunset had significantly less expression of the enzyme compared to noon, but insignificant expression levels compared to other groups. The decrease of the enzyme would mean a decrease in chromophore production in the cells.

Interestingly enough, two "hypothetical" proteins; ssl2501 and  were found to be differentially expressed in the experiment, 

The results are show us that the output of the pipeline is biologically plausible, since the proteins differential expression has been proven in previous studies. If the differentially expressed proteins of the ralstonia data set were to be analyzed more thoroughly, about 13 out of the total 267 unique  differentially expressed proteins would be expected to be false positives, due to the threshold of 0.05 set for the q-value. The differentially expressed proteins for the ralstonia bacteria can be found in table \ref{table:ralstonia-proteins}.
