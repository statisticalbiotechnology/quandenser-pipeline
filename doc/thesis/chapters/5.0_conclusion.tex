\section{Conclusion}

The new pipeline allows an easy way of analyzing MS files with Quandenser, without requiring multiple dependencies and due to containerization of the software, it allows the pipeline to run on HPC clusters with Singularity as it's only dependency. The pipeline also allows user to convert vendor files directly in the pipeline, minimizing the need to preconvert the files before processing and without the need of other frameworks.

The processing time of the pipeline is also considerable faster than MaxQuant, a popular mass spectrometry analyzing software, and slightly faster than OpenMS. However, the parallel implementation of Quandenser did not improve the computation time significantly. The combination of faster processing time and being able to run on HPC clusters will be useful for

Differentially expressed proteins found in cyanobacteria grown in different simulated environments were confirmed in previous studies,
