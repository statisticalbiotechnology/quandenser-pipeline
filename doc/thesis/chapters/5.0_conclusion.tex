\section{Conclusion}

Quandenser-pipeline is a mass spectrometry pipeline which is designed to be easy to use and as a wrapper for Quandenser and Triqler. The performance of the pipeline is better than MaxQuant on both data sets, but has a similar performance compared to the custom OpenMS pipeline, while the parallelization of Quandenser shows only a slight performance increase on smaller data sets compared to running the Quandenser in a non-parallel mode.

The biological data of differentially expressed proteins show us the how the proteome of cyanobacteria behaves during different times of the day, where the bacteria changes it's internal proteome to gather light from higher wavelengths before and after noon while changing it's energy metabolism to acclimate for the changes.

In conclusion;
