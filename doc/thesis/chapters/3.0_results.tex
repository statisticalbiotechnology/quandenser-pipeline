\subsection{Pipeline performances}

The programs were run on a computer with an Intel Core i7-4790k CPU @ 4.0 GHz with 32 Gb of memory. The following histogram show the processing time of Quandenser pipeline, OpenMS and MaxQuant for the two data sets.

  \caption{\textbf{Processing time on local computer (wall time)}. QP is the newly created pipeline and the y-axis of the plots shows the wall time (i.e. the processing time) of the different pipelines. Lower is better (less time to finish the pipeline). The plot at the left illustrates the processing time of the cyanobacterial data set (10 files, about 0.8 Gb each), while the plot at the right is the processing time of the ralstonia data set (20 files, about 1.3 Gb each). Note that \textit{parallel} Quandenser used a maximum of two forks (aka two processes in parallel), which was the maximum the computer could handle}

  \caption{\textbf{Core minutes to finish process on local computer}. The y-axis of the plots shows core hours used (i.e. how much the computer resources used) of the different pipelines. Lower is better (less resources used). The plot at the left illustrates the processing time of the cyanobacterial data set (10 files, about 0.8 Gb each), while the plot at the right is the processing time of the ralstonia data set (20 files, about 1.3 Gb each). Note that \textit{parallel} Quandenser used a maximum of two forks (aka two processes in parallel), which was the maximum the computer could handle}

  \caption{\textbf{Timeline of parallel processing of the cyanobacteria data set on the local computer.} Note that \textit{quandenser\_parallel\_1} is "fully" parallelizable while \textit{quandenser\_parallel\_3} is partially parallelized, following a minimum spanning tree explained in section \ref{ssec:quandenser-method}. The rest of the processes are non-parallelizable. A maximum of two forks was set (aka two processes in parallel)}

  \caption{\textbf{Timeline of parallel processing of the cyanobacteria data set on UPPMAX.} The caption of figure \ref{fig:timeline-local} explains the processing names. The grey area of each bar represents SLURM queue time for each process. Unlimited amounts of processes was set, meaning no limit was set to the amount of parallelized processes possible}

\subsection{Biological data}

The cyanobacteria experiment groups were divided in five groups; before sunrise (A), after sunrise (B), noon (C), before sunset (D) and after sunset (E) with two replicates each. From the cyanobacterial data set, each combination of experiment groups were compared to one another, i.e. all groups were compared to all other groups. For the ralstonia dataset, the same method applied.

For the cyanobacteria dataset, a total of 24 proteins between groups were found to be differentially expressed, which consisted of 10 unique proteins (shown in table \ref{table:cyano-proteins}). For the ralstonia dataset, a total of 760 proteins between groups were found to be differentially expressed, which consisted of 267 unique proteins. Due to the large amount of unique proteins found in the ralstonia data set, the ralstonia proteins were not analyzed.

The five experiment groups are before sunrise, after sunrise, noon, before sundown and after sundown. The proteins are divided into two plots; the top plot is proteins with a lower expression in the noon compared to before sunrise, while the plot at the bottom is proteins which has a higher expression during noon when comparing to before sunrise}
