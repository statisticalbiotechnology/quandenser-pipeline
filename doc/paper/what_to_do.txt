NOTE: QP --> Quandenser Pipeline


MUST:

• Run datasets with QP
Latosinska PXD002170
Bracht PXD00147
Boxcar PXD009348 (files ending with "F") OBS: Improve merge method

Run with normal pipeline, cluster
Run with normal pipeline, local
Run with parallel pipeline, cluster

Check wall time and cpu time.

SHOULD:

• Run MaxQuant on the datasets. Sadly, it will not be able to run on the cluster.
but running QP on with a "local" run of will show that it is indeed faster
on the same type of computer. The parallel QP run on cluster will test how fast
it will go. However, due to "waiting time" of the slurm queue, the wall time might
 differ greatly. Theoretically with no wait time, it would go super fast.

• Improve or change boxcar merge methods before running the Boxcar set
2 methods completed, but consider c++ or similar to improve the merge method.
Add changes here:

COULD:

• Run the huge data set with QP
Weightloss PXD004242 (1291 files)

• Run the KNIME pipeline on the data. This part is tricky, since it is possible
to parallelize this pipeline as well and run on clusters, if OpenMS is installed.
But a run with this would also be possible if we want to add it in the report.
