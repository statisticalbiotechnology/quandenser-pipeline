\section{Objectives}

The main objectives for the project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop a Singularity container for a software named “Quandenser” \cite{quandenser}, which processes label-free MSdata for protein quantification.
\item A NextFlow pipeline, which will integrate the singularity container produced in the previous step.
\item Apply the data for two different microbial datasets generated in Paul Hudson’s lab using tandem-MS, one of which was created by growing cyanobacteria under different conditions \cite{michael}. The microbial data sets were generated by analyzing the proteome of two different lithotrophic bacteria.
\end{enumerate}
