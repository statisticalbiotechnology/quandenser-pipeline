\hline
Risk & Likelihood & Impact & Prevention\\ \hline
Work computer breaking down & Low & High & Store the project on github and the main files on an external hard-drive \\
Incompatible data from microbial set & Medium & Medium & The underlying software should be able to handle most of the data and if not, integrate the packaged conversion program to fix the data. \\
Unfixable errors in the underlying programs & High & Medium & Find a workaround for the program and if possible, use another program instead \\
Sickness & High & Low & Most of the work is on github and I can run the analyses on a data cluster, so I can easily work from home if I get sick. \\
