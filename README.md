# quandenser-pipeline
A nextflow/singularity pipeline for quandenser


Todo:

  - Debug output and find out why output from container != non-container
  - Limit RAM usage (container uses about twice as much RAM as non-container)
  - Make batch file use relative file locations (would make it much easier to run on cluster)


Extra features (might be added):

  - CLI or GUI (using pyside2 or kivy)
  - Start and stop pipeline where you want (integrate with user interface?)
